### Hi there ðŸ‘‹

I'm James - a web/software developer.

I've been on this journey with code for about two years now, and I'm always fascinated by how deep everything is and how much there is to learn.

Currently, I mostly work in JavaScript with a focus on React, but I've dabbled with TypeScript a bit and have other languages and frameworks on my radar that I'd love to learn.

You can see my work at https://jamescalingo.dev, or read some of my thoughts at https://jamescalingo.com.

I can also be found <a href="https://linkedin.com/in/james-calingo" target="blank">on LinkedIn</a>.
